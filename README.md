This repository contains my personal dotfiles.

To set up these dotfiles on your system, simply clone the repository and run `make` in the repo directory. 
This will automatically create the necessary symlinks:

```
git clone https://github.com/andreasglashauser/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
make
```

Note that before running the `make` command, it's a good idea to back up any existing dotfiles in case you want to revert later.
